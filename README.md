### ✅ Task A — Gender Classification
A deep learning model trained to classify face images into **Male** or **Female**, even under **blur, lighting, or occlusion distortions**.

### ✅ Task B — Identity Recognition with Distorted Faces
A smart, real-time face recognition pipeline that can match **distorted test images** to their original identity folders using **self-supervised transformer embeddings** and **multi-head voting**.

---

## 🔬 Model Architectures Used

| Task | Model | Highlights |
|------|-------|------------|
| A | `EfficientNet-B2` | Combined with Focal + Label Smoothing Loss for balance |
| B | `DINOv2` + `Faiss` + `Multi-head Verification` | Handles distortions with contrastive embeddings |

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔹 Task A Pipeline

* 💡 Advanced `albumentations` augmentations
* ⚖️ Balanced Focal Loss + Label Smoothing Loss
* 🧠 `EfficientNet-B2` as the backbone
* 📈 Comprehensive evaluation (balanced accuracy, per-class breakdown, visualizations)

> **✅ Achieves over 90% Balanced Accuracy**

---

### 🔹 Task B Pipeline (Sherlock/Tony Stark Style)

* 🤖 Self-supervised embeddings from **DINOv2**
* 🎛️ Multi-head augmentation with blur, motion, brightness noise
* 📍 **FAISS Index** for nearest-neighbor identity match
* ✅ Voting mechanism for robust identity assignment under distortion

> **🎯 Achieves 98–99% Top-1 Accuracy even on distorted queries**

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Task | Metric            | Score    |
| ---- | ----------------- | -------- |
| A    | Balanced Accuracy | ✅ 90%+   |
| B    | Top-1 Accuracy    | ✅ 98–99% |
| B    | Macro F1 Score    | ✅ 0.97+  |

## 🧪 Testing Interface (Colab Ready)

```python
# Single Image
predict_single_image('/content/drive/MyDrive/test.jpg')

# Multiple Images
predict_multiple_images([
    '/content/drive/MyDrive/test1.jpg',
    '/content/drive/MyDrive/test2.jpg'
])

# Batch Folder Test
batch_test_folder('/content/drive/MyDrive/test_folder/', max_images=5)
```

## 🏆 Hackathon Ready

This repo is engineered to:

* Run directly on **Google Colab** (no local setup required)
* Handle **real-world image noise**
* Surpass baseline AI models with **self-supervised power**
* Deliver explainable results with visual metrics

---

## 📢 Notes

* Ensure your images are face-centered.
* GPU runtime is recommended for DINOv2.
* All results can be reproduced by running the notebooks top to bottom.
